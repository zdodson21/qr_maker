The following requirements must be met:

* User must be able to generate QR Code, insert an image, and download the QR code on all testable platforms (Linux, Windows, Android, maybe Web?)
* Must display error state when applicable (show message when over character limit, block input or else app crashes lol).
* Should set colors based on light and dark mode.
* Try to avoid scope creep lol, but I could make it so users can save their qr codes in a menu, then they can select a QR code to display.
